# Bunch of 3D shapes for use with kicad my component footprints

Till the time I figure out a way have relative paths work properly for
3D shapes, you'd have to clone this repository somewhere and add a
symlink to it (or clone it) in the system wide 3d packages path
of your kicad installation (for e.g.: `/usr/share/kicad/modules/packages3d` on linux).

# Models

* Through hole WOM diode bridge
* EL14 decoupling transformer (Made it for 600 Ohm 1:1)
